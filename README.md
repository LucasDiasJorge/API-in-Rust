Here's a README template for your Rust project that outlines the flow of the code, focusing on models, controllers, authentication, and database connection. This can serve as a guide for beginners looking to understand the structure and functionality of the application.

# Rust Web Application with Authentication

This project is a simple web application built using Rust and the Actix framework. It demonstrates how to implement user authentication, handle JSON data, and connect to a PostgreSQL database. The application provides endpoints for user registration and login, utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Programming language used to build the application.
- **Actix Web**: A powerful web framework for Rust.
- **SQLx**: An asynchronous, compile-time SQL query library for Rust.
- **Bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: A library for creating and validating JSON Web Tokens.
- **dotenv**: A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database used for data storage.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several modules to separate concerns:

```
src/
│
├── controllers/
│   ├── auth.rs         # Contains functions to handle authentication requests
│
├── models/
│   ├── user.rs         # Defines user data structures
│   ├── response.rs      # Defines response structures for JSON responses
│
├── services/
│   ├── auth_service.rs  # Contains business logic for authentication
│
├── main.rs             # The main entry point of the application
└── lib.rs              # Library file to manage modules
```

## Models

In the `models` module, we define the structures that represent our data. For instance:

- **User**: Holds user credentials and other related data.
- **LoginData**: Used for login requests, containing username and password.
- **SuccessResponse** and **ErrorResponse**: Define the structure for API responses.

Example of `models/user.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct LoginData {
    username: String,
    password: String,
}
```

## Services

The `services` module contains business logic for authentication. This includes functions to handle user registration and login, as well as generating and validating JWTs.

Example of `services/auth_service.rs`:

```rust
pub async fn login(pool: &PgPool, info: &LoginData) -> Result<SuccessResponse> {
    // Logic to validate user credentials and generate JWT
}
```

## Controllers

Controllers are responsible for handling HTTP requests and sending appropriate responses. They use the services to perform operations on the data.

Example of `controllers/auth.rs`:

```rust
pub async fn login_handler(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, info: web::Json<LoginData>) -> impl Responder {
    match login(pool.get_ref(), &info).await {
        Ok(response) => HttpResponse::Ok().json(response),
        Err(err) => HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json(ErrorResponse {
            success: false,
            message: err.to_string(),
        }),
    }
}
```

## Database Setup

1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Make sure PostgreSQL is installed on your machine.
2. **Create a Database**: Create a new database for the application.
3. **Set up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your database URL:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/db_name
   ```
4. **Create User Table**: Execute the following SQL command to create the `users` table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Build the Project**: Run the following command to build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
2. **Run the Application**: Start the server with:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
3. The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /register**: Register a new user. Requires `username` and `password` in JSON format.
- **POST /login**: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT. Requires `username` and `password` in JSON format.
- **POST /json**: A protected route that requires a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.

## Testing the Application

You can use the following bash script to test the endpoints:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Test user registration
echo "Testing registration..."
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser", "password":"password123"}'

# Test user login
echo -e "\nTesting login..."
response=$(curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser", "password":"password123"}')
token=$(echo $response | jq -r '.message')

# Test protected route
echo -e "\nTesting protected route..."
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/json -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"John", "age":30}'
```

Make sure you have `jq` installed to parse JSON responses.

## Conclusion
